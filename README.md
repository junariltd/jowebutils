# Odoo Website Form Utilities

Odoo has an awesome metadata-driven back-end but its support for developing
forms for the front-end is pretty much non-existant at the moment! As a developer
you must manually hand-code all the form elements, input controls, error handling
etc.

This module provides a set of helper QWeb templates and python functions to make
website portal development less painful!
